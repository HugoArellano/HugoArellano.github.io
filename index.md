<div align = "justify"In my old job, from time to time I was to look up some official surveys and extract insights in order to support a bunch of tasks like reports, study, and development of law proposals, political analysis, and so on.

So, I did those jupyter notebooks as a kind of cheat sheet, if you work with similar data likely you find it helpful.</div>
